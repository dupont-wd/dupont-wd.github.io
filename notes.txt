1) Install git
2) Create or open project

Any new device needs a key uploaded, search for github guide. 

git remote add origin git@github.com:dupont-wd/dupont-wd.github.io.git

The password for my work computer (which I don't think I need) is
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAID8aZNHr8oOsGP2Kx3IGYc7bFGTNzEb3Ng+MJXB9PsGc william.dupont@vumc.org

To publish changes go to 
Tools --> version control --> committ...
Then 
Tools --> version control --> Push Branch

I think.  I could not get this to work.

The RStudio program for my web page is index.Rmd
