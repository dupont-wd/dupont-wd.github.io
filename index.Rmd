## About

I have worked for the last forty years in collaboration with clinical investigators at Vanderbilt, and for over a decade with Dr. Smith on research concerning the genetic and molecular epidemiology of prostate and breast cancer. Over the prior years, we have collaborated to comprehensively understand the genetic architecture of a prominent cancer risk locus, and to develop accurate clinical risk prediction models encompassing prostate cancer risk loci. Much of my career has been focused on the application of novel and robust biostatistical techniques to the analysis of large databases as part of large epidemiologic studies and clinical trials. As part of this work, I have built and validated complex models of risk prediction. I have coauthored 248 peer-reviewed papers and been the principal investigator of five R01 grants. Most recently, we have collaborated on a study of the effects of tumor mutation burden on survival among patients with 32 types of cancer. This reference is given below on which I am the corresponding author. Four publications from my research with Dr. Smith are:

### Contributions to Science

My most important contributions to science have concerned the relationship between benign breast disease and breast cancer risk. I have been the principal investigator on five of NIH R01 grants on this topic.  In collaboration with Drs. David L Page, Jeffrey R Smith, and other clinical colleagues I have followed a cohort of 17,000 women with histologically confirmed benign breast disease and have performed nested case-control studies of histologic, immunohistochemical and genetic risk factors for breast cancer in these patients. This work has changed the clinical management of benign breast disease by distinguishing between those benign lesions that were, and were not, associated with increased breast cancer risk. More recently, I have collaborated with Dr. Smith on studies of familiar prostate cancer. Four important publications from this research are as follows:

* Dupont WD and Page DL:  Risk factors for breast cancer in women with proliferative breast disease.  N Engl J Med, 1985; 312:146-51. PMID: 3965932.
* Hartmann LC, Degnim AC, Santen RJ, Dupont WD, Ghosh K. Atypical hyperplasia of the breast--risk assessment and management options. N Engl J Med. 2015; 372(1):78-89. PMCID: PMC4347900.
* Dupont WD, Blume JD, Smith JR. Building and Validating Complex Models of Breast Cancer Risk. JAMA oncology, 2016; 2(10):1271-1272. PMCID: PMC5278770.

I have had a long-term interest in developing and facilitating power and sample size calculations. I designed and supervised the writing of the PS program for performing these calculations. This free software is extensively used by bio-medical scientists (search for PS power and sample size). Four publications on this topic are as follows:

* Dupont WD:  Power calculations for matched case-control studies. Biometrics, 1988; 44:1157-68. PMID: 3233252
* Dupont WD and Plummer WD:  Power and sample size calculations:  A review and computer program.  Controlled Clin Trials, 1990; 11:116-28.  PMID: 2161310.
* Dupont WD and Plummer WD: PS power and sample size program available for free on the Internet.  Controlled Clin Trials,1997;18:274.
* Dupont WD and Plummer WD: Power and sample size calculations for studies involving linear regression.  Controlled Clin Trials, 1998; 19: 589-601. PMID: 9875838.
 

I am interested in the philosophical foundations of statistical inference, and how these principles should be used to improve inferences in medical science. Four papers on this topic are as follows:

* Dupont WD:  Sequential stopping rules and sequentially adjusted P values:  Does one require the other?  Controlled Clin Trials, 1983; 4:3-10. PMID: 6851579.
* Dupont WD:  Rejoinder:  statistical inference from trials with sequential stopping rules.  Controlled Clin Trials, 1983; 4:27-33. PMID: 6851578.
* Dupont WD: Ethics and statistics in randomized clinical trials-comment. Stat Science, 1991; 6:69-71.
* Choi L, Blume JD, Dupont WD: Elucidating the Foundations of Statistical Inference with 2 x 2 Tables. PLoS ONE. 2015; 10(4):e0121263. PMCID: PMC4388855.
 

I have collaborated as a co-investigator and biostatistician with Drs. W.A. Ray and C.P Chung on studies of pharmacoepidemiology. These studies have assessed clinical and genetic risks for azathioprine-associated leukopenia in routine clinical practice, the association of inflammation and comorbidity burden in patients with lupus erythematosus, the effect of short-acting opioids on opioid-related adverse events in adolescents,  the mortal risks associated with long-acting opioids prescribed for non-cancer pain and the risks of hospital associated bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation associated with apixaban or rivaroxaban.

I have collaborated as a co-investigator and biostatistician with Dr. Tina V. Hartert and colleagues on the causes and prevention of asthma. We have found considerable evidence that infantile bronchiolitis increases the risk of childhood asthma. Proving this association and finding ways to prevent lower-tract respiratory infections in infancy could have a major impact on health care costs and quality of life by reducing asthma incidence.  Four publications on this research are as follows:
